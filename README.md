An automated Twitter bot written in Python attempts to review wine
and usually makes hilarious mistakes. Sometimes it drinks too much
and quotes Edgar Allan Poe. Inspired by @mechnicalpoe; base script
by @robincamille.

This idea started as a social experiment. I personally cannot tell
the difference between a bottle of $20 wine and $200 wine. I am
curious what likes, retweets, etc. the bot will get from its
nonsensical logic.

Future ideas include better databases, more randomized tweets, and
more automated interaction. I have also thought about using the
Markov chain in one of its random tweets and fill the bot with a
large wine-related script.

Drink one for me.
